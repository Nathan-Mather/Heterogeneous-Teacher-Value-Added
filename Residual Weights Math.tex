I am just laying out the math for the weighted residuals regression to help me think through it, to communicate you you both, and possibly to use it in slides/paper eventually. 
\\

First define some terms: 
\\

Let $Y$ be a vector of post-test scores. Let $X_1$ be a matrix of pretests and demographic controls. Let $X_2$ be a matrix of teacher dummies (the dosage matrix). Let $X$ be a matrix of both $X_1$ and $X_2$
\\

\section{Standard VA}
The standard regressions gets coefficients by: 
$$\beta_{ols} = (X'X)^{-1}X'Y $$

We could also get the teacher coefficients ( the value added) by first partialing out the pretest and controls and then regressing the post test on the residuals of the first regression. So first we get 

$$\beta_1 = (X_1'X_1)^{-1}X_1'X_2 $$

then let $R_1$ be the residuals of the above regression 
$$ R_1 = X_2 - X_1 \beta_1$$

Then we get the teacher value added with 

$$ \beta_2 = (R_1'R_1)^{-1}R_1'Y $$

The teacher coefficients in $\beta_{ols}$ and $\beta_2$ are equal.

\section{Weighted VA}

Now for the weighted value added. We start off with the same first step as the partialling out method above. That is we again need 
$$\beta_1 = (X_1'X_1)^{-1}X_1'X_2 $$

and
$$ R_1 = X_2 - X_1 \beta_1$$

Now, however, we also need a weight matrix $W$. For the second regression we get weighted value added with 
$$\beta_{W} = (R_1' W R_1)^{-1}R_1' W Y $$
